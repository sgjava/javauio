Java UIO Tools provides CLI programs, so you do not have to compile code with
hard coded pins, ports, etc. Note that the native library jar has a suffix such
as linux32, so depending on your target platform it could be different.
 
## Run tools
* `java -cp $HOME/javauio/tools/target/tools-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:$HOME/javauio/u8g2/target/u8g2-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-linux32.jar com.codeferm.u8g2.CodeGen --help`
